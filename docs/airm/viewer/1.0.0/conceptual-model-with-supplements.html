             A RTSA message relates to the execution phase. It addresses an evaluation process performed at a specific time triggered by a specific event concerning the ARES status (activation, de-activation, modification) to match the existing plan (AUP / UUP) to the actual life performance. Identified delta will initiate a new plan. In addition it also addresses any change to existing plans (AUP / UUP) prior to their execution in real time, triggered by an event on the day of operation.

The update of the RBT/RMT can also be triggered on request or periodically.

Derived from the number of movements and amount of fuel burn, the average fuel burn for each flight in the phase for the airspace kind is derived. The amount of fuel burn is derived from the fuel burn in related PhaseOfFlight.

Before an E-DPI is sent, it is required that the Airport CDM Platform matches the flight plan and airport slot.

Subsequent DPI messages work as updates to previously sent information, containing progressively more accurate information. The automated transmission of the DPI messages is triggered by system events derived from the Milestone Approach processes at the airport. Each DPI message relates to a single flight only. The Network Operations processes the DPI messages received and if necessary, the CTOT is re-calculated (improved or deteriorated). A Flight Update Message (FUM, see below) is sent by the Network Operations to the flight's next destination airport.

This is typically accomplished  by  upgrading various  ATM  support tools or  enabling  navigation,  communications  or surveillance infrastructure;  c) reviewing  and  updating  ATM  procedures  induced  by  changes  to airspace  design  and  technical infrastructure; d) reviewing staffing practices to evaluate the potential for matching staffing resources with workload and the eventual need for adjustments in staffing levels; and  e) reviewing the training that has been developed and delivered to ATFM stakeholders.

             Departure Planning Information message sent between off-blocks and take-off. It serves to supply the Network Operations with a very accurate Target Take-Off Time (TTOT) based on the ATC established and stable departure sequence. It will allow a better monitoring of departures and will facilitate the identification of late updates requiring specific attention.

Three manoeuvres can be requested from the trailer aircraft: - Remain behind, - Merge then Remain behind, and - Vector then Merge (then Remain) behind. Once the spacing is acquired, the three manoeuvres behave the same way i.e. maintain the requested spacing within the requested tolerance.

             The FTP is a point over which the final approach segment path passes at a relative height specified by the reference datum height. It is defined by the WGS-84 latitude, longitude and ellipsoid height. The FTP replaces the LTP when the final approach course is not aligned with the runway extended centreline or when the threshold is displaced from the actual runway threshold. For non-aligned approaches the FTP lies on the intersection of the perpendicular from the FAS to the runway threshold. The FTP elevation is the same as the actual runway threshold elevation.

             In the atmosphere, convection is the dominant vertical transport process in convective boundary layers, which are common over tropical oceans and, during sunny days, over continents. Moist convection in the atmosphere is characterized by deep, saturated updrafts and downdrafts, and unsaturated downdrafts driven by the evaporation and melting of precipitation. This form of convection is made visible by cumulus clouds and cumulonimbus clouds in the case of precipitation convection.

This is typically accomplished  by  upgrading various  ATM  support tools or  enabling  navigation,  communications  or surveillance infrastructure;  c) reviewing  and  updating  ATM  procedures  induced  by  changes  to airspace  design  and  technical infrastructure; d) reviewing staffing practices to evaluate the potential for matching staffing resources with workload and the eventual need for adjustments in staffing levels; and  e) reviewing the training that has been developed and delivered to ATFM stakeholders.
