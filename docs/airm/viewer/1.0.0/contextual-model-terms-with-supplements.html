It currently includes the management and provision of queues both on the ground and in the air. Traffic synchronization, as a function, is closely related to both demand/capacity balancing and separation provision and may in the future be indistinguishable from them. Traffic synchronization also concerns the aerodrome service" part of the concept."

The system safety approach uses systems theory, systems engineering and management tools to manage risk formally, in an integrated manner, across all organizational levels, all disciplines and all system life-cycle phases.

For the modern photogrammetric cameras equipped with forward motion compensation (FMC) devices and photogrammetric panchromatic black and white emulsions, the resolution could (depending on contrast) be 40 to 80 lp/mm (line pairs per millimetre).

             The capability of a sensor to discriminate levels or intensity of spectral radiance. In the analogue systems such as photography, the radiometric resolution is measured based on the number of grey levels that can be obtained. In opto-electronic systems, the radiance is recorded in an array of cells. A digit is assigned to each cell proportional to the received level of energy. This is done by an analog to digital converter in the platform. Generally, in modern sensors the range is between zero radiance into the sensor and 255 at saturation response of the detector.

             Is a measure of delay variance against a performance dependability target. As the variance of expected delay increases, it becomes a very serious concern for airlines when developing and operating their schedules. Conceptually, predictability metrics should be a comparison of the actual flight time to the scheduled flight time, since the scheduled time includes the amount of expected delay at a targeted dependability performance.

To the extent possible the descent profile is comprised of idle-power performance descent profile segments and geometric descent profile segments that maximize altitude, minimize the thrust required to remain on the path, terminate the path at the desired end location and satisfy the altitude and speed constraints along the closed path design. Note.- OPD is one method of facilitating CDO.

For any hazard (i.e. any condition, event or circumstance that could induce an accident), a risk can be identified as the combination of the overall probability or frequency of occurrence of a harmful effect induced by the hazard, and the severity of that effect. The terms accident and incident are defined in Annex 13 - Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation.

             The FTP is a point over which the final approach segment path passes at a relative height specified by the reference datum height. It is defined by the WGS-84 latitude, longitude and ellipsoid height. The FTP replaces the LTP when the final approach course is not aligned with the runway extended centreline or when the threshold is displaced from the actual runway threshold. For non-aligned approaches the FTP lies on the intersection of the perpendicular from the FAS to the runway threshold. The FTP elevation is the same as the actual runway threshold elevation.

             A generic term describing equipment which broadcast distinctive signals on designated frequencies and, depending on application, may be automatically activated by impact or be manually activated. An ELT may be any of the following: Automatic fixed ELT (ELT(AF)). An automatically activated ELT which is permanently attached to an aircraft. Automatic portable ELT (ELT(AP)). An automatically activated ELT which is rigidly attached to an aircraft but readily removable from the aircraft. Automatic deployable ELT (ELT(AD)). An ELT which is rigidly attached to an aircraft and which is automatically deployed and activated by impact, and, in some cases, also by hydrostatic sensors. Manual deployment is also provided. Survival ELT (ELT(S)). An ELT which is removable from an aircraft, stowed so as to facilitate its ready use in an emergency, and manually activated by survivors.

             Autorotation:a rotorcraft flight condition in which the lifting rotor is driven entirely by action of the air when the rotorcraft is in motion. During powered flight, the rotor drag is overcome with engine power. When the engine fails, or is deliberately disengaged from the rotor system, some other force must be used to sustain rotor RPM so controlled flight can be continued to the ground. This force is generated by adjusting the collective pitch to allow a controlled descent. Airflow during helicopter descent provides the energy to overcome blade drag and turn the rotor. When the helicopter is descending in this manner, it is said to be in a state of autorotation.
