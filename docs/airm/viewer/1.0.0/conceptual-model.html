The FTP replaces the LTP when the final approach course is not aligned with the runway extended centreline or when the threshold is displaced from the actual runway threshold. For non-aligned approaches the FTP lies on the intersection of the perpendicular from the FAS to the runway threshold. The FTP elevation is the same as the actual runway threshold elevation.

             In the atmosphere, convection is the dominant vertical transport process in convective boundary layers, which are common over tropical oceans and, during sunny days, over continents. Moist convection in the atmosphere is characterized by deep, saturated updrafts and downdrafts, and unsaturated downdrafts driven by the evaporation and melting of precipitation. This form of convection is made visible by cumulus clouds and cumulonimbus clouds in the case of precipitation convection.
