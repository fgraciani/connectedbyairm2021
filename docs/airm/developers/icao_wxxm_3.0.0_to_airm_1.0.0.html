             An Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) report is a routine aerodrome forecast intended for distribution beyond an aerodrome.  TAF reports report base forecast conditions, and modifications to those conditions throughout the valid period. TAF reports include similar information to a METAR/SPECI trend forecast. However, TAF forecast information includes additional detail. Aerodromes can issue both METAR/SPECI and TAF reports on a routine basis, but TAFs are not issued by every METAR-reporting aerodrome. The issuance of a new forecast by a meteorological office, such as a TAF, cancels any forecast of the same type previously issued for the same place and for the same period of validity or part thereof. Prevailing conditions and forecast changes differ in that the prevailing conditions can include temperatures, base conditions do not include a change indicator, and that forecast changes may report no significant weather (NSW). Rather than have two class hierarchies, constraints are present ensuring that each (base and forecast conditions) only include relevant information

             A special (i.e., non-routine) observation made at an aerodrome as needed. SPECI observations are made (and distributed) in accordance with criteria established by the meteorological authority, in consultation with the appropriate ATS authority, operators and others concerned. The information contained in METAR and SPECI is identical. SPECI is issued when conditions merit a non-routine report on conditions at an aerodrome. SPECI reports are used for dissemination beyond the aerodrome of origin (mainly intended for flight planning, VOLMET broadcasts and D-VOLMET) unless METAR are issued at half-hourly intervals. SPECI is issued following the resumption of the issuance of METAR, as necessary, at aerodromes that are not operational throughout 24 hours in accordance with ICAO Annex 3 Section 4.3.1. See ICAO Annex 3 / WMO No. 49-2 Table A3-2

             A SIGMET (significant meteorological) report. SIGMETs report the occurrence and/or expected occurrence of specified en-route weather phenomena which may affect the safety of aircraft operations, and of the development of those phenomena over time. The SIGMET report class represents the base SIGMET types that may be reported such as squall lines, thunderstorms, dust storms, turbulence, etc. Tropical cyclone and volcanic ash SIGMET reports are subclasses of SIGMET due to their ability to report additional information, including volcano/tropical cyclone identification and forecast position(s). SIGMETs may report either observed or forecast hazardous conditions. Additionally, a forecast position may be reported.

             The reported vertical visibility.  Vertical visibility is defined as the vertical visual range into an obscuring medium. Measured vertical visibility shall be reported in either two units of measures: meters (m") or feet ("[ft_i]"). Note: vertical visibility is only reported in aviation-specific WMO Code-forms (FM-15 METAR, FM-16 SPECI and FM-51 TAF) thus prevailing visibility is considered to be an aviation-specific quantity. When the sky is obscured and the value of the vertical visibility cannot be determined by the automatic observing system due to a temporary failure of the system/sensor ("VV///") the vertical visibility is missing with a nil reason of notObservable"
